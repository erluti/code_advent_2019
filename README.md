My work for [Advent of Code 2019](https://adventofcode.com/2019)

This is the first time I've ever done Advent of Code.  My strategy is to get to a solution quickly.  So I'm trying to keep the code contained in one file.  Normally I would make a pass at the code to make it much cleaner before "going to production", but once a solution is found there's not much need to go back.  My tests are taken from the examples in the prompts, so shoring up those tests would be one of the main things I did before being content with the code.

Day2 mentioned reusing the work there, so when that happens, I'll probably do some refactoring and possibly restructuring of this repo.
